# Jarvis ESP32 Project

## Overview

Welcome to the Jarvis ESP32 project, featuring an LVGL-powered UI. Inspired by Jarvis UI, this project integrates seamlessly with the [`Chronos app`](https://chronos.ke) through the [`ChronosESP32`](https://github.com/fbiego/chronos-esp32) library. This enables BLE synchronization for time, weather, and notifications.
